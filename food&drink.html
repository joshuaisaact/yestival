            <p>Friday evening we’ll be putting on the grills and enjoying our first evening on the good vibes planet with a yummy BBQ. <br><br>
                
                Our farmer friend has sourced us with a local meat pack, combined with some delicious veggie and vegan alternatives, expect a feast fit for the sexy underwater alien cowboys you all are. 🍔🌭<br><br>

                Saturday we are bringing in the wonderful Let’s Go Street food. They will be providing fresh breakfast rolls for brunch… (as always vegan and veggie options available) what better than rolling out of bed and grabbing that easy fix.<br><br>
                
                Later in the day they will be transforming into their signature Mexican street food set up. That’s right we have 2 hours of UNLIMITED Mexican food from their menu. Burritos filled with chicken, beef or yummy jackfruit with all the toppings… and who doesn’t like nachos? Extra beef chilli? Don’t forget that guac. The rocket fuel you need to party long into the night.🌮🌯🇲🇽<br><br>
                
                Sunday morning we have a very special goodbye breakfast to see our Yestopians off into the stratosphere. We will keep that secret for now but trust us it’s super fun and the perfect end to our wicked weekender…<br><br>
                
                I’m getting peckish reading all this aren’t you?<br><br> Prepare for lift off at Yestival 🧨 🚀</p>
