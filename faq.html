            <h3>What is the Drink situation?</h3>
            <p>Yestival is ofc BYOB but we know that everyone likes a nice cold drink In the sunshine.<br><br> We will have a large refrigeration unit and a bar on site where you can buy from a selection of alcoholic and alcohol free beers, canned cocktails and soft drinks. All super reasonably priced!🥤 🍺 🍹<br><br> 

                A kettle and complimentary coffee and tea will also be provided for you caffeine junkies. ☕️ 🫖</p>
            <h3>Where the heck is it?</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to get to Yestival is to drive. Put "Ark Buffalo Projects" into Google Maps and you will find it. <br><br>
                
                The location of the field is 5 mins up the road from there but we will drop a pin and little map in the week before.<br><br>

                It’s about an hour outside London and an hour and a half from Bristol.<br><br>
                
                </p>

            <h3>What about parking?</h3>
            <p>We have unlimited free parking space. Campervans etc are welcome. <br><br>
                
            For those that can’t drive, we are trying to organise lift shares, but if you need to get the train then Winchester is the nearest station, and you can get a taxi (about 20 mins drive)<br><br></p>
