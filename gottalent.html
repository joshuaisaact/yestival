    <p>Howdy partners 👋<br><br>

        Saturday night while you chow down to your unlimited Mexican feast… we need some light entertainment don’t we? Lights camera action it’s YESTIVAL’s GOT TALENT. Join us round the campfire near the big top and show off if you so please. Nawty Nick will be doing his classic karaoke rendition of Mysterious Girl complete with dance moves, Bonkers Ben might do a bit of shit children’s magic, we have friends doing spoken word, a little acoustic guitar, stand up…Whatever you so please. No pressure of course you’re welcome to munch away and laugh and enjoy the show, but if you want to perform as always get in touch with one of us!
